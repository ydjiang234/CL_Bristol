I am writing to apply for the research associate position of the SAFER project, which was advertised on the  University of Bristol website. I am a near complete PhD student in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology at the Istituto Universitario di Studi Superiori di Pavia (IUSS) with an expected graduation date of May 2018.

I am deeply attracted by your SAFER project, which includes innovational seismic device design and challenging shaking table tests. As a candidate, here are what I could immediately bring to the table:

Laboratory Experiences: In my PhD research, I characterized the flexural behaviour of concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns by conducting experimental tests, which included test campaign preparation, test setup design, specimen preparation, test conduction and data post-processing. Additionally, I also have some laboratory experiences during my research assistant period in Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I assisted to prepare the CFST specimens and to conduct the steel coupon tests.

Earthquake Engineering Background: As a postgraduate student in Earthquake Engineering, I have been exposed to a variety of seismic specified courses, especially the ``Seismic Design of Foundation`` and the ``Seismic Isolation and Dissipation``, which I believe can make me adapt to your project smoothly.

Programming Skills: My qualified programming skills in Matlab and Python have provided me with a good ability to handle the large scales of work and the wide range of parametric study. Moreover, I have some basic knowledge of C++, which enable me to develop customized material for OpenSees.

Experience of Presenting Research Findings and Authoring Research Papers: As my curriculum vitae illustrates, there are 3 journal and 8 conference papers which are authored or co-authored by me. In the meantime, I have attended 6 conferences and workshops to present my research achievements orally.

My background, laboratory experiences and programming skills have qualified me for the research associate position. My curriculum vitae is enclosed for your kind perusal. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
