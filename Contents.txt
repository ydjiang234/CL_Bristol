Dear Dr Alexander:
\par
%Introduce briefly myself and the purpose of the letter
I am writing to apply for the Research Associate position of the project SAFER, which was advertised on your university website. As a near complete PhD candidate at the Istituto Universitario di Studi Superiori di Pavia (IUSS), I am expecting to graduate in May 2018.
I am extremely interested in obtaining your Research Associate at the University of Bristol, where I can continue my research on earthquake engineering and step into the first stage of my academic career.
\par

%Why I fit with your position.
%What the job requires
\iffalse
Knowledge of advanced dynamics, including earthquake engineering
Strong knowledge of structural engineering
Knowledge of foundation design
Experience of experimental testing programs
Experience of shake table experimental testing.
\fi
I obtained my bachelor degree in Civil Engineering at Tongji University, where I developed a solid background in structural engineering.
As an MSc and PhD candidate in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology, I have a very strong background in structural engineering and dynamics.
During the course study period of my MSc and PhD. I had taken the courses (e.g. Fundamentals of Seismic Design, Seismic Design of Foundations, Seismic Isolation and Dissipation, e.t.c), which I believe can be useful for your projects.
Within my research works in MSc and PhD period, I have experience in conducting experimental tests on Concrete-filled Steel Tubes.
Moreover, I had worked at the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity as an exchange student in 2017, where I had assisted the preparation of specimens and coupon tests of steel properties.
Therefore, I believe that I had enough experimental tests experience.

\iffalse
%Ability to program in Matlab
%Strong ability in mathematically modelling
\fi
Despite my solid background in Earthquake Engineering, I have also skills to use software tools to assist my research works. Throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate study, I had developed good programming skills in Matlab, Python, C++ etc. I have used the programs to deal with large sets of data, generating graphs.



\iffalse
%Experience of presenting research findings at conferences and authoring research papers for journals
%Proven ability to write and publish journal articles
%Experience of delivering presentations at scientific conferences
\fi
During my MSc and PhD period, I have published more than 10 journal and conference papers as first author or second author. So I am experienced in authoring research papers.
During my MSc and PhD period, I have attended 5 conferences (e.g. STESSA15, 16WCEE, EuroSteel2017, etc. ) and presented my research findings orally.



%Communication and Interpersonal Skills
%Good written and spoken English.
%Strong organizational and teamwork skills.
During my PhD research, I had assisted my supervisors to guide the master final project of two MSc students from IUSS. 
In the exchange period in HongKong PolyU, I had also collaborated with PhD student of the host university to investigate the study of Octagonal CFST columns.


%The motivation of my application
As approaching the end of my PhD period, I am looking for a suitable research position to start my academic career.
The University of Bristol, which is very strong on engineering, only in the UK, but also all over the world, attracts me.
Your research group, which is specifically in Earthquake Engineering and have lots of achievements in the previous year, had attracted me. I think your group is very suitable for me, not only in aspects of my research interests but also be good to my academic career. 

%Finnal declaration
As a high standard research group, I understand that the competition for the Research Associate position is hard.
I believe that my academic capability and efforts would contribute to your research group demands. 


Sincerely,\\
Yadong Jiang
