Dear Dr Alexander:
\par
%Introduce briefly myself and the purpose of the letter
I am writing to apply for the Research Associate position of the project SAFER, which was advertised on your university website. As a near complete PhD candidate at the Istituto Universitario di Studi Superiori di Pavia (IUSS), I am expecting to graduate in May 2018.
I am extremely interested in obtaining your Research Associate at the University of Bristol, where I can continue my research on earthquake engineering and step into the first stage of my academic career.
\par

%Why I fit with your position.
%What the job requires
\iffalse
Knowledge of advanced dynamics, including earthquake engineering
Strong knowledge of structural engineering
Knowledge of foundation design
Experience of experimental testing programs
Experience of shake table experimental testing.
\fi
I obtained my bachelor degree in Civil Engineering at Tongji University, where I developed a solid background in structural engineering.
As an MSc and PhD candidate in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology, I have a very strong background in structural engineering and dynamics.
During the course study period of my MSc and PhD. I had taken the courses (e.g. Fundamentals of Seismic Design, Seismic Design of Foundations, Seismic Isolation and Dissipation, e.t.c), which I believe can be useful for your projects.
Within my research works in MSc and PhD period, I have experience in conducting experimental tests on Concrete-filled Steel Tubes.
Moreover, I had worked at the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity as an exchange student in 2017, where I had assisted the preparation of specimens and coupon tests of steel properties.
Therefore, I believe that I had enough experimental tests experience.
